I am a geospatial ecologist and Assistant Project Scientist in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Merced.

My research interests focus on applications of remote sensing, spatial modeling, and data science to support ecological monitoring, habitat restoration, and conservation decision-making. I specialize in integrating UAV, satellite, and airborne remote sensing data with geospatial and statistical modeling techniques to monitor invasive species, map vegetation structure and composition, and assess floodplain dynamics in diverse ecosystems, from the Arctic tundra to Californiaâ€™s inland waterways.

My work is driven by a commitment to reproducible science, open data, and collaborative research that bridges the gap between ecological understanding and real-world environmental management.
